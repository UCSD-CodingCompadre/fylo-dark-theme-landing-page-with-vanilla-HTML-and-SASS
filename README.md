This challenge was completed by Raul Uriostegui Jr on 9-9-2022.
This is the repository that holds my solution. 

# Learning outcomes
This project incorporates vanilla HTML, SASS, and JavaScript DOM Manipulation. I was able to analyze a UX/UI design that is mobile responsive and create a landing page that is realistic enough for an actual company to use. I learned how to structure code in a professional manner that any frontend developer can follow my logic and see where certain sections of the landing page are located.

# Challenges
This project posted a challenge because I had to now find a method for me to structure my HTML code in order to take into account the varies elements that can be included in a landing page of this caliber. Another challenge came along with the CSS because the mobile page and desktop page needed some restructuring in order to make the page mobile responsive.
